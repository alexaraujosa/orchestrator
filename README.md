## VSCode debugging
There are three debugger configurations included: `Debug Client`, `Debug Server` and `Debug Server + Client`. Their name describes their targets.

`Debug Server + Client` requires two consoles to work, but the other two can be configured to run on the integrated terminal by setting `externalConsole` to `false` on their configurations.

## Recommended Extensions
This project contains a set of extensions that are required for the debugger to work. VSCode marks them as "recommended", but they are mandatory.
